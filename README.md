## 📝 Project Overview

**As of 07/17/2025**

### 📌 Project Name:

**Barakoti Auto Sales**

### 🎯 Goal of the App

- React.js
- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Cloudinary

> **Note:** This is not a commercial application but a personal project for learning and portfolio purposes.

### 🚀 What the App Does

- Users land on a homepage with a video background and clear navigation.
- From there, they can access the **Inventory** page to view available vehicles.
- Selecting a vehicle reveals a **Details View** with additional images and specifications.
- Future enhancements will include features like: inventory search, loan applications, admin dashboard in React, print/share options, and more.
